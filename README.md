# 👋 Hi, I'm José Félix  

**Full-Stack Developer | Product Builder | SaaS-Driven Mindset**  

I build digital products with a strong focus on real-world problems, clean architecture, and scalable systems.  
What started as curiosity became obsession. What became obsession turned into execution.

- 🧠 Design and build **end-to-end web platforms**

- 🔐 Implement secure authentication flows (JWT, role systems, permissions)
- 💳 Integrate payment systems and SaaS monetization logic
- ☁️ Deploy production-ready apps (Railway, environment management, CI mindset)

I don't just code features.
