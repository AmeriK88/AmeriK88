- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmeriK88
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and all it has to offer. I started this as a hobby, but soon enough I realized I would like to make a living out of it. It has been a couple of years, but step by step I have managed to improve on my own.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various libraries and modules in Python language. I have knowledge in html, css, and javascript and I would like to improve my python skills by working on various personal projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas and whatever I proyects that help me gain more skills to continue in this field.
- 📫 How to reach me ... You can reach me by email.
- 😄 Pronouns: ...He :)
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...If you spend over 8 hours doing a job that you enjoy, you won´t work a single day in your life.
